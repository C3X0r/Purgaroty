[+] Logging functionality doesnt work, because it needs to be exected on a separate thread in the message pump or the procedure, because otherwise it will 
    be caught in an infinte while loop, it cant break out of - this implementation is because Logging of windows messages is done for the code sandwiched between 
    "startLog()" and "endLog" functions respectively.
    
[+] Fix bitwise implementation of arguements of the "startLog" function.

[+] Fix memory leak , most probably caused by some handle not closing properly.
